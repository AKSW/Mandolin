# Vector distance functions.
#
# Add your new distance functions in this file.
#
# Each distance function is defined by the line:
#     <name>.class=[fully specified class name]
#
# Implementation:
# These must implement the netkit.util.DistanceMeasure interface
# and have a public default constructor.
# They can optionally also implement Configurable.
#

# ==============================
# COSINE(v1,v2)
# ==============================
# returns the cosine distance between two vectors.
cosine.class=netkit.util.DistanceCosine

# ==============================
# L1(v1,v2)
# ==============================
# returns the L1 (manhattan) distance between two vectors.
l1.class=netkit.util.DistanceL1

# ==============================
# L2(v1,v2)
# ==============================
# returns the L2 (euclidean) distance between two vectors.
l2.class=netkit.util.DistanceL2
