# Weka classifiers.
#
# Add your weka classifer configurations in this file.
#
# Required line:
#     <name>.class=[fully specified class name]
#
# Implementation:
# These are weka classifiers and must implement weka.classifiers.Classifier
# They are assumed to come with the weka.jar public toolkit.   You can write
# your own weka classifier, in which case you should read the weka manual.
# (this is a third-party toolkit: http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/index.html)
